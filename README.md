This is a very small program I made for my own convenience. I was playing Guerilla Games' "Horizon Zero Dawn" and keeping track of all the inventory items and what to do with them became tedious.
I didn't want to build a relational database for this game so I just threw all of the input string into a pickle and called it a day.

This program could feasibly be used for any other game with an inventory that gets to tiresome.
It has to be run from cmd. -HELP will give you the options of what you can do and wrong input will be dealt with accordingly.
